# 🎌 August's Japan Travel Tips 🗾 - Work In Progress!

This is a guide for anyone who's travelling to Japan and is planning their trips or wondering what to do. I've included things like restaurants, tourist destinations, travel information, and basic language help. 

**Everything in this guide is based on personal experience and opinion-based, so feel free to disagree.** This is to ensure you don't get tips like "I've heard from this guy, who heard from this guy, this was pretty good" - no, everything is verified. Please also be advised that this is all from the perspective of a Swedish (European) guy, and as such my culture is very dissimilar to Japanese culture in many ways - yours might not be.

## Review the guide!

If you visited any of the places listed in the guide, it'd be fun to know what you thought - please feel free to use the "issues" tab as a sort of review section.

## Language, conduct, and culture

Japanese people are often viewed as polite.

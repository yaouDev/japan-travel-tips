# August's Travel Style

This guide will be aimed at how August travels whenever he visits - lightly packed & taking advantage of the general convenience of things. You might want to edit your list according to your preference.

## What To Pack

August usually just brings a carry-on backpack (see what sizing applies on your airline)

* 3-4 days worth of clothing (obviously less if you don't plan to stay that long) - larger hotels and some hostels will have laundry machines you can pay to use, otherwise there are also laundromats. Detergent is usually applied automatically.
* Phone charging cable (USB or USB-C)
* Headphones (the flight is loooong (from Europe))
* Water-proof shoes - it rains in Japan, especially in June/July (tsuyu season). Don't bring your nice brogues unless you have a backup pair.



## How To Get to the City From the Airport

Get a Suica/ICOCA/Passmo card - this is used to pass through train gates without having to purchase a ticket each time. Suica is available for e-Wallets - and take the train. It's always the cheapest option, and you can go from Haneda, Narita, and Kansai directly into the city. Not all of them go to the "main" station, though, so you're urged to check where the stops actually are. E.g, if you're going to Ginza, you can probably get off at Shimbashi.

Naturally there are also buses (which can take you directly to your hotel (double-check!)) and taxi, but you can count on that being a looot more expensive.

## First Stop (before or after checking into your hotel)

Typically I'll go into a little-bit-of-everything store such as Don Quijote and pick up:

* Undershirts
* Underwear
* A plug for the Japanese outlet to charge my phone with (1500 yen ish). Japan uses Type A plugs (two flat pins, same as ungrounded US plugs). Three-pronged grounded plugs usually won’t fit without an adapter - which you should get if you're bringing a laptop or such. Japan uses a different voltage than many other countries and as such you need to triple-check your electronics before plugging them in.
* Sunscreen (in summer)
* Toothbrush and toothpaste (note that Japanese toothpaste is quite flavorless)
* Deodorant (otherwise only found in pharmacies or in limited variety in conbini)
* Some weird-looking snack (like dried squid)
* Umbrella (if it's raining) (300-500 yen ish)
* Razor & shaving cream - not always supplied by hotels

Note that this type of store can be overwhelming, especially if you're very jetlagged or are arriving late at night. Conbini usually stock much of the list but can be limiting.

The reason August doesn't bring this from home is because 1; it's relatively consumable and cheap(er) (undershirts/underwear), 2; "difficult" to bring on the plane (umbrella/shaving cream), 3; there are fundamental differences of how things work (outlet adapters). The point being to purchase better adapted products and potentinally getting rid of them before going back home, rather than paying more than the purchase price of them to bring a larger suitcase. Not very eco-friendly perhaps, but that's the corporations' fault - and if you're bothered you can pay for the suitcase on the way home and still save money (or donate the clothes!).

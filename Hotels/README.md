# Hotels

## Things to double-check

* It's not uncommon for hotels to charge per person, be sure to check what applies!
* Some hotels don't give you a towel or charge for one (esp. hostels). You can buy one in most conbini, though (7-Eleven/Lawson/etc).
* Don't expect staff to speak english unless you're staying at an actual hotel or at a resort (or hostel in some cases). 



## Pricing

* Hostel/Capsule Hotel: 2000 - 7000 yen / night
* Hotel (cheaper):  5000 - 12,000 yen / night
* Hotel (price-y): 20,000 yen +
* Ryokan: 20,000 yen +

## Hotel types

### Regular Hotels

Argubaly just like any other standard international hotel. I will mention that the good ones tend to be very good, and the bad ones tend to be very bad, though. Usually there will be a common bath area in addition to your on-suite shower/bath. Do note that these bath areas typically won't allow tattooed people in.



### Business Hotels

Usually cheaper than a normal hotel and to a lesser standard. They're mainly meant for salary men (business men) to use when they have to travel inter-city, i.e., no real commodities. These will usually be near a station (ekimae). Ideal if you're just passing through a place.



### Ryokan (traditional)

Traditional Japanese inn. Will typically have a bookable onsen (hotspring) or a private onsen bath in the room. Food will be served depending on what package you choose, but typically you'll get dinner and breakfast included, consisting of traditional cuisine (usually very good food). You'll sleep on futon (bed rolls) and have traditional clothing supplied (yukata/kimono). It's really like a whole traditional experience, and if you're unsure on exactly what moments and what service is included I urge you to ask the staff at the inn you're staying at. Keep in mind these are usually relatively expensive and remote - usually the ryokan itself is seen as the destination for travel.



### Capsule Hotels

While they might seem like a fun novelty, you will enjoy sleeping in one for roughly 1 night before you're fed up with them. Go with a business hotel instead (if you can afford it)



### Manga-kissa / Karaoke

You might've heard of manga cafés or karaoke places which are open 24/7 where you can rent a booth overnight for very cheap (1000-2000 yen), and had influencers or similar recommend to sleep there. I wouldn't do that unless you are seriously desperate for a room, or a sadist.



### Love Hotels

Offers time-limited stay or overnight, usually incredibly shady, in shady areas, and since they're made for adult activities the sheets have probably seen a lot. Personally never visited one, and never want to. Might be the cheapest option in some cases, but weigh your pros and cons.

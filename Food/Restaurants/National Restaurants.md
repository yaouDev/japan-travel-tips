* Torikizoku (\*) - Yakitori (grilled chicken skewers) speciality shop. Always good quality, tasty, relatively cheap, good opening hours, and usually good seating layout. { torihada (chicken skin) chips (don't knock it 'til you try it!) }



## Café

* Starbucks Coffee - Might be an unexpected entry, however, the Starbucks in Japan is usually in cozy/special locations and have an interesting seasonal special. Difficult to fully recommend, but not worth avoiding! { seasonal special }
* Hoshino Coffee - Usually an "old-timey" iterior style with a calm atmosphere. Menu is typical of Japanese café cuisine. Also a nice place to have breakfast at.

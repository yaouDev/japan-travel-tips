## Izakaya/Bar

* [Shin](https://maps.app.goo.gl/9MiVdAgfVe4ama1s6) (\*) - Modern and authentic izakaya in central Namba with a nice menu and friendly staff, surrounded by other izakaya. Some seats are quite narrow! { Heshiko (salt-fermented fish, usually saba) & Tantakatan (shiso sake) }
* [Tori Bene](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FX4MYQM9sjbzrf8x9) - Everything is smoked! Quite small and hidden away on the streets of Sennichimae in Namba. { Set-menu (box) } 
* [Tanuki Chaya](https://maps.app.goo.gl/dqDuj8Hj8RxsJvqU9) - Good standard izakaya for a typical experience. The chefs are in the same room and offer the food to you on oars. Near Sennichimae/Nippombashi
* [Bar Bota](https://maps.app.goo.gl/k3SKQGjBGx1EH8R59) - Cocktailbar with a nice view, especially at night. Total skybar feeling with decent cocktails. Feels luxurious.
* [Majimeya](https://maps.app.goo.gl/FQd769Ykaprs92sq5) (\*\*\*) - Gyoza and chicken wing speciality izakaya, however, everything is delicious. Since it's a franchise it exists in other places too, but this location is in an underground izakaya-only mall near Umeda. They've got really cheap happy hour, "mystery" dishes, and you get to roll for a reward on your way out (usually free dishes for next time). August has cancelled fancy dinner plans just to return here. { Torihada-kushi (chicken skin skewer) } NOTE: underground, [take these stairs to enter](https://maps.app.goo.gl/um9pRfPuxLReyeey7)



## Yakiniku

* [298PREMIUM](https://maps.app.goo.gl/ySv1z3eDUgenH2Yc9) - Super cheap yakiniku and all-you-can-drink
* [Otona no Kobe-gyuu](https://maps.app.goo.gl/8VUQYyL4gZEV8v858) - Expensive meat, but relatively low prices



## Okonomiyaki

* [Okonomiyaki Bonkuraya](https://maps.app.goo.gl/TcDi6qac4qfeTPib8) - Traditional teppanyaki (fry at your table) with a nice view of the Dotonbori Canal. A bit touristy.



## Takoyaki

* [Takoyaki Wanaka Sennichimae](https://maps.app.goo.gl/6iYESzjQSN6rvZLo9) - Pretty good takoyaki in Namba, two story seating behind the shop. Takoyaki is what it is.



## Noodles

* [Mita Seimenjou](https://maps.app.goo.gl/vwzcT4qiZsjs7qyY7) - Noodle shop in Namba with good standard. Definitely order tsukemen. { tonkotsu tsukemen (pork-broth thick noodles) }



## Tonkatsu

* [Tonkatsu](https://maps.app.goo.gl/nYznRZSYshDS8y3U7) (\*) - Small, seemingly family-owned tonkatsu place. Probably the best tonkatsu I've ever eaten, served the proper way. NOTE: owners are grumpy. { regular tonkatsu set-meal }



## Kaiseki

* [Osaka-ryori Asai](https://maps.app.goo.gl/GP75EsSeGpejkuiV8) - Omakase-style set menu restaurant. Good, fresh ingredients, feels fulfilling but atmosphere could be more cozy.



## Buffet

* [Atmos dining](https://maps.app.goo.gl/N4FJXtXz6NDrqvjr7) - Nice and tasty buffet with good dessert. Nice view of the northern part of Osaka from Nakanoshima



## Cafés

* [Caffé Ciao Presso](https://maps.app.goo.gl/HyQjuoEfg7YSv6wo6) - Typical Japanese chain café but with a very nice view over downtown (Tennouji/Shinsekai). Reasonable prices. Go here if you're in the area and don't want anything specific.
* [Paris-h](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jbYV3gyRv6fKAaEA7) - French/bread-y pastries. No seats in-house but near Tosahori river/Nakanoshima Banks walk where there are seats.



## Sushi

* [Daiko Sushi Honten](https://maps.app.goo.gl/EYmyxuy3RVSwTuc39) - Authentic, cheap, and tasty sushi. In a walking mall in Shinsekai so can be crowded. Picture menu available (write your number on a note as the order)

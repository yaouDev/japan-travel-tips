### August-star (\*)

The ratings system is as follows;

There is a star system of 0 - 3 stars (star = \*). Being awarded an August-star is of the same significance as getting a Michelin-star, so while making the list means the restaurant is good, a starred restaurant is truly great. There is no concrete framwork as to what needs to be fulfilled in order to receive an August-star, it is determined completely by intuition, though, that may be based on food quality, atmosphere, pricing, service, etc. As each entry is followed by a short description, you are urged to read each entry in full.

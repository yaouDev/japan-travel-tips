# Restaurants

## Typical Japanese Dining Experience

NOTE: It's not uncommon for places (mostly izakaya) to charge a "table charge" (お通し代 (otoshidai)) of ~500 yen (sometimes per person). Usually, but not always, this will include an appetizer (so if you're served a small dish that you didn't order, this is probably it).

### Restaurant

Typically, you order one main dish which is accompanied by rice. If you order a set menu you will most likely have things like miso soup, salad (typically cabbage), tsukemono (pickled vegetables), or other more meal-specific items such as raw egg, konbu, tenkasu, katsuobushi, etc.

Other meals, such as ramen, will be the foundational dish and you'll get to choose specific toppings, though, a lot of meals are served as set menus.

In general, the japanese diet is heavy on rice, fish, and soy/sodium. It can be difficult to get consistent vegan meals as even chefs are sometimes unaware of what contains animal-based products (e.g., dashi). Roots are also very common; daikon, renkon (lotus root), sweet potato (different variety than european!), wasabi (many different parts of the plant), etc. NOTE: "wasabina" is *not* wasabi paste; it's the leaves of the root.

As far as beverages are concerned you'd typically be served water and/or tea (esp. hot tea in the winter). Ordering a beer to go along with your food is not uncommon either, but you seldom see japanese people order anything else (except in places like McD). That said, sodas and whatnot are usually available from the menu.

Spices and sauces available at the table will typically be salt, soy, and shichimi (seven spices).



### Izakaya

Food is ordered to be shared among all of you, typically everyone starts with a draft beer and edamame (you don't have to, obviously). Menu items are mostly meant to complement alcoholic beverages but treating it like a dinner works just fine, although it will be more expensive to get full. Dishes are typically tapas-sized (i.e., relatively small).



## Eating Etiquette

Note that breaking etiquette is fine, but at least be aware that you are.

### General conduct

* Leaving food left over is heavily frowned upon - especially at all-you-can-eat places like yakiniku restaurants (you may be asked for additional payment if you do)



### Chopsticks

* Don't pass things from chopstick to chopstick
* Don't pierce your food with your chopsticks
* Don't put your chopsticks upright in rice - it's a funeral tradition and you might be told off for it



### Sushi

* Don't add wasabi - it's already under the fish
* Don't dip the rice in soy - only the fish (turn it over)
* Eat it in one bite
* Yes, you can remove the shrimp tail if you'd like
* Traditionally it's meant to be finger food, though, reactions may vary
* Don't ask for swap-outs if you're ordering a set menu



### Noodles

* No, slurping does not mean you're "telling the chef it's tasty" - it will, however, help cool the scorching hot noodles you will be served. Seriously, you'll get burns if you don't.
* Some places offer bibs - it may seem stupid but if you're wearing white I'd recommend wearing one



## Location Legend

### Links

Every link will be to Google Maps.



### Restaurant description

The description of each restaurant is written to be as consice as possible.



### August-star (\*)

The ratings system is as follows;

There is a star system of 0 - 3 stars (star = \*). Being awarded an August-star is of the same significance as getting a Michelin-star, so while making the list means the restaurant is good, a starred restaurant is truly great. There is no concrete framwork as to what needs to be fulfilled in order to receive an August-star, it is determined completely by intuition, though, that may be based on food quality, atmosphere, pricing, service, etc. August's sensory ability to feel *"vibes"* is impeccable. As each entry is followed by a short description, you are urged to read each entry in full.

That said, restaurants on the list are **NOT** just places I've tried - they're places I've tried *and* found worthy enough to recommend to people.



### {} - Curly brackets

August's recommended order (might be omitted in generic cases)



## Calligraphy & Remembering Your Dishes

Some restaurants, especially traditional & izakaya, will have most of their menu in japanese in stylized japanese calligraphy which can make it difficult to read or translate through an app. As such, I'd recommend writing down the names of the dishes and/or ingredients you try and like so that you can ask for them.

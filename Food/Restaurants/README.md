## Typical Japanese Dining Experience

### Dining Conventions

* It's not uncommon for places (mostly izakaya) to charge a "table charge" (お通し代 (otoshidai)) of ~500 yen (sometimes per person). Usually, but not always, this will include an appetizer (so if you're served a small dish that you didn't order, this is probably it).
* Some places, especially izakaya and in winter, will give you a small, warm towel (oshibori) before your meal which should be used to clean/warm your hands. Some use it on their face as well, but it's not the intended use. Usually it's free, but I've been charged for it before - even so it's more or less compulsory.
* Paying is usually done at the register, not at the table (may vary!).
* Tipping is not very common - it might even confuse the poor staff.
* As most places - card-acceptance may vary. Bring cash.
* Ramen/sushi/counter seated shops tend to have a high turnover rate in customer visits. You get your food quickly, eat quickly, then leave quickly.
* Menus tend to be skewed to the current season. If you visited in spring last time and are visiting in autumn now; many of the dishes that were available previously will be missing.

### Being Seated & Ordering

You'll be seated at your table and then the staff will leave you alone until you ask "sumimasen", raise your hand, or press a button. The staff won't hover at your table (as is norm).

The ways you order can differ greatly between establishments:

* Through a conventional menu
* Through a vending machine which you then offer to the staff
* Through a digital tablet
* Through a conventional menu, and you write numbers/dish names on a piece of paper and hand to the staff

### Queuing

In general, long queues are seen as indications that the restaurant is good. If there is a restaurant with no guests and a restaurant with a one hour queue, there is a tendency to choose to join the queue.

* Queues can be *very* long
* Some places offer solutions where you can write your name (and numer of guests) on a paper list or on an app, and they'll call your name out when it's your turn. Note that your name might not sound the same in Japanese and your native language.


### Restaurant

Typically, you order one main dish which is accompanied by rice. If you order a set menu you will most likely have things like miso soup, salad (typically cabbage), tsukemono (pickled vegetables), or other more meal-specific items such as raw egg, konbu, tenkasu, katsuobushi, etc.

Other meals, such as ramen, will be the foundational dish and you'll get to choose specific toppings, though, a lot of meals are served as set menus.

In general, the japanese diet is heavy on rice, fish, and soy/sodium. It can be difficult to get consistent vegan meals as even chefs are sometimes unaware of what contains animal-based products (e.g., dashi). Roots are also very common; daikon, renkon (lotus root), sweet potato (different variety than european!), wasabi (many different parts of the plant), etc. NOTE: "wasabina" is *not* wasabi paste; it's the leaves of the root.

As far as beverages are concerned you'd typically be served water and/or tea (esp. hot tea in the winter). Ordering a beer to go along with your food is not uncommon either, but you seldom see japanese people order anything else (except in places like McD). That said, sodas and whatnot are usually available from the menu.

Spices and sauces available at the table will typically be salt, soy, and shichimi (seven spices).



### Izakaya

Food is ordered to be shared among all of you, typically everyone starts with a draft beer and edamame (you don't have to, obviously). Menu items are mostly meant to complement alcoholic beverages but treating it like a dinner works just fine, although it will be more expensive to get full. Dishes are typically tapas-sized (i.e., relatively small).

Note that some izakaya will allow smoking. Usually there are seperate seating for smoking/non-smoking.

## Eating Etiquette

Note that breaking etiquette is fine, but at least be aware that you are.

### General conduct

* Leaving food left over is heavily frowned upon - especially at all-you-can-eat places like yakiniku restaurants (you may be asked for additional payment if you do).



### Chopsticks

* Don't pass things from chopstick to chopstick
* Don't pierce your food with your chopsticks
* Don't put your chopsticks upright in rice - it's a funeral tradition and you might be told off for it



### Sushi

* Don't add wasabi - it's already under the fish
* Don't dip the rice in soy - only the fish (turn it over)
* Eat it in one bite
* Yes, you can remove the shrimp tail if you'd like
* Traditionally it's meant to be finger food, though, reactions may vary
* Don't ask for swap-outs if you're ordering a set menu



### Noodles

* No, slurping does not mean you're "telling the chef it's tasty" - it will, however, help cool the scorching hot noodles you will be served. Seriously, you'll get burns if you don't.
* Some places offer bibs - it may seem stupid but if you're wearing white I'd recommend wearing one



## Location Legend

### Links

Every link will be to Google Maps.



### Restaurant description

The description of each restaurant is written to be as concise as possible.



### August-star (\*)

The ratings system is as follows;

There is a star system of 0 - 3 stars (star = \*). Being awarded an August-star is of the same significance as getting a Michelin-star, so while making the list means the restaurant is good, a starred restaurant is truly great. There is no concrete framework as to what needs to be fulfilled in order to receive an August-star, it is determined completely by intuition, though, that may be based on food quality, atmosphere, pricing, service, etc. August's sensory ability to feel *"vibes"* is impeccable. As each entry is followed by a short description, you are urged to read each entry in full.

That said, restaurants on the list are **NOT** just places I've tried - they're places I've tried *and* found worthy enough to recommend to people.



### {} - Curly brackets

August's recommended order (might be omitted in generic cases)



## Calligraphy & Remembering Your Dishes

Some restaurants, especially traditional & izakaya, will have most of their menu in japanese in stylized japanese calligraphy which can make it difficult to read or translate through an app. As such, I'd recommend writing down the names of the dishes and/or ingredients you try and like so that you can ask for them.

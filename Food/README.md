# Japanese Food & Variations

This is not necessarily a list of good japanese food, merely a collection of food that are unique to Japan or are different from what might be popular in your country. That said, most of it is really good.

**KEEP AN OPEN MIND!** Many things that are common in Japan may seem strange to you, but I encourage you to step out of your comfort zone and try as many things as you can. Half the enjoyment of visiting Japan is because of their good food!!

**If I could make one preparatory suggestion** it would be that you limit your sugar/sweetness consumption drastically before going to Japan - probably at least two weeks in advance. This is because confectionary and such as not as sweet as they are in the West, hence they will not taste as good initially.

## What to try

This is mostly a list of different food and drink which might be different from what exists in the West.

Included here is a score from 1-5 on how badly you need to try these things (or avoid!). The score is based on deliciousness, uniqueness, and palette fatigue resistance (if you can eat it every day).

### Food/Meals


* Ramen {} - 
* Sushi {} - 
* Tonkatsu {} - 
* 


### Otsumami

Otsumami is the name of izakaya "tapas" or "snacks to eat while drinking".

* Edamame {2} - Kind of self explanatory. Good starter and I order it often, but available at home (for me).
* Karaage {4} - Fried chicken. The Japanese spice blend is a bit different. Always a safe choice.
* Agedashi {3} - Fried tofu in dashi stock. Not bad but kind of "meh".
* Kushikatsu {4} - Fried food on a skewer. Can be many different things, but usually vegetables or meat. Popular in Osaka and has nice variation.
* Yakitori {5} - Grilled chicken skewer. The Japanese variations are really good and are often charcoal grilled. Be sure to check which part you order though.
* Takowasa {1} - Raw octopus and wasabi. Yeah. As good as it sounds.
* Chanja {0} - AVOID! Spicy/salty cod entrails (Korean?)


### Sweets & Wagashi

* Mochi {3-5} - Sticky rice cake. Arguably the most popular confectionary, arguably a must-try. Not very sweet by itself but exists as different versions (e.g. daifuku). [Read more about mochi uses/types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mochi#Popular_uses)
* Dango {3-5} - Similar to mochi, but more like a dumpling as it's made with rice flour as well. Augusts #1 sweet in Japan is kibi-dango, made with millet flour. [Read more about dango types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dango#Types)
* Jelly {2} - Jelly is very popular in Japan but it's always underwhemlming.
* Anko (filling) {3} - Sweet red bean paste. One of the most common fillings in mochi, doughtnus, and ice cream. It's better than it sounds but the coarse versions' texture is a bit unsettling.
* Kinako (powder) {5} - Toasted soybean powder. Used as topping on e.g. mochi and ice cream, and is a common flavor on e.g. soymilk. August really likes it.
* Youkan {2} - Thick jelly slice made from anko, agar, and sugar. Kind of tasteless, especially the "water" (mizu) version. Usually exist in different flavors which could potentionally be nice.
* Manjuu {3} - Like a daifuku (mochi with anko filling), except the skin is made of flour. It's not more exciting than mochi.
* Pudding {2-3} - Unfortunately, Japan's pudding is not really what your palette expects other than the consistency. Some are better than others but in general they're quite mild and pointless.



### Drinks (non-alcoholic)

Conbini note: Usually there are "shot like" drinks that look like medications; they're not, it's usually energy drinks or for different "health benefits" such as making your hangover the next day less painful. It can be difficult to know their exact effect, but they're not inherently harmful if you want to try one (some may contain high amounts of caffine).

* Green tea {4-5} - Almost more common than water. August likes tea, but if you don't, well, get used to it because you can't avoid it. It's usually good quality tea, though.
* Matcha {4} - If prepared traditionally it's usually very good, and in a setting where it would be prepared like that you're probably in a nice setting.
* Coffee {3-4} - August likes coffee, but Japans coffee is either bottled with milk and sugar, or black and cold. Main point is; if you're from the West, you probably won't find readily available ways to have coffee the way you're used to. That said, local roasters are plentiful and it could be fun to embrace it as a new experience.
* Pocari Sweat / Aquarius {5} - Electrolyte sports drink. Claims to rehydrate better than water and it does feel like it. Not overly sweet and have the classic sports drink taste. I won't say it's super delicious or anything, but it's always a stable choice for rehydration, and widely available.
* Pepsi (canned) {5} - I don't know why, but the canned pepsi that you can find in vending machines in Japan is so, so good.
* Coca-Cola variations {2} - Japan has a few exclusive Coca-Cola flavors, though, usually they're worse than the conventional alternatives. (Coke Clear, Coke Coffee, etc).
* Melon(/cream) soda {4-5} - Just a really good flavor soda, sometimes it will have the flavor of a vanilla float. Augusts favorite is the Fanta Melon Soda, specifially in the metal bottle.
* Kireeto Lemon {4} - "Shot like", with massive amount of lemon juice in it. Taste is sweet and sour and it will make your face twitch. Nice wake up on a hot summer day.
* Oronamin C (energy drink) {3} - "Shot like", contains lots of vitamins. Nice pick-me-up without being overly caffinated.
* Cider/saidaa {2} - Not like the western cider. It's more like sugar-y sparkling water.
* Calpis {4} - Milk-based beverage, almost yoghurt-like (in taste). Unless it says "water" or "soda", it's probably a concentrate meant to be mixed with something.
* Soy milk {3-4} - Lots of different flavors, and most are pretty good! August particularly likes banana flavor.
* Choco-mint drink (KALDI) {5} - This is  specific; the grocery chain Kaldi has a particular choco-mint drink that is really good, one of Augusts favorites. In recent years people seem to have caught on though, and now they sell out fast, so be quick!

### Alcohol

In Japan, "sake" (酒) simply refers to alcohol in general. For the beverage "sake" refers to in English - see "Nihonshu".

Some of these are scored "1-5" as the term is too generic to accurately give a score, e.g., beer/whisky.

* Sour {4} - Usually lemon. Not the cocktail you might be thinking of, it's more like a spritz or a seltzer. Incredibly common.
* Highball {2} - Whisky with club soda, not great, but very common. Ginger (ale) highball is better.
* Strong Zero {2} - Technically considered a chuuhai but has its own social status. 9% alcohol but doesn't taste like alcohol - so, dangerous. Not really Augusts' thing, but incredibly popular, especially with foreigners.
* Umeshu {5} - Plum wine, very sweet. Usually wine-strength (10-15%). Very good, and also a nice gift to bring back home.
* Yuzushu {5} - Yuzu (citrus) wine, very sweet. Basically the same as umeshu but based on yuzu instead. Very good.
* Nihonshu {1-5} - Fermented rice wine. This is what is usually denoted "sake" - which it technically is since it's alcohol. Just like normal wine there are a vast array if different production techniques and flavors. In winter it could be nice to order it "atsukan" - heated. [Read more about the varieties that influence flavor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sake#Varieties)
* Shouchuu {1-5} - Distilled spirit made from barely, sweet potato, rice, or similar. Not to be confused with korean soju or nihonshu/"sake".
* Chuuhai {5} - "Shouchuu Highball"; soda water, flavoring, and shouchuu. Tastes like a western cider but with more varies flavors. Usually around 4,5% alcohol.
* (Japanese) beer {1-5} - The Japanese mostly drink their own brands of beers, and the most popular ones are very light lagers. Arguably, Asahi, Kirin, and Sapporo are the most popular brands. Draft beer (nama/生) is most commonly Asahi or Asahi Super Dry (at least is Osaka), which August thinks tastes like sparkling water. Augusts' favorite brand is Yebisu (the "Y" is silent).
* (Japanese) whisky {1-5} - The most common whisky in Japan is, of course, Japanese whisky. August is not very well versed in the differences here, but if you are, there's a lot to choose from. Note that blends are incredibly common so make sure to look for single-malt if you care about taste.

## Unique Flavors

* Ice cream - calpis, anko, japanese cider
* Milkshake - sweet potato
* Chips - soy sauce, consomme
* Soda - melon, grape

## Western Food in Japan

Unfortunately, most western food is not very good in Japan. Deli foods such as sausage and cheese are massively disappointing, at least from a European perspective. Hamburgers are underwhemling and pizza is OK but expensive, for some reason. Be skeptical of "western" food, you're almost always better off just choosing Japanese food instead.

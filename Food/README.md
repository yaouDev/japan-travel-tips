# Japanese Food & Variations

This is not necessarily a list of good japanese food, merely a collection of food that are unique to Japan or are different from what might be popular in your country. That said, most of it is really good.

**KEEP AN OPEN MIND!** Many things that are common in Japan may seem strange to you, but I encourage you to step out of your comfort zone and try as many things as you can. Half the enjoyment of visiting Japan is because of their good food!!!

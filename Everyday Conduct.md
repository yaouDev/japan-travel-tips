## Conduct & Etiquette

Simple things to make you fit in better - don't worry, though. Everyone knows you're a foreigner and acknowledges that you don't know everything about their culture. Japanese people may break some of these too occationally.

Strict rules marked with "\*" - More relaxed "rules" marked with "$"

* No talking on the phone while on the train *
* Mind your talking volume on the train (or in general if you're American)
* Don't walk and eat $
* Don't wipe your nose $ (odd, I know)


## Bowing

Bowing is very common, but most likely you won't really need to learn all the "types". Most notably it's used to acknowledge the gesture of another person, e.g, greeting/thank you/excuse me. This will be a very shallow bow, more like a slight nod - you'll catch on when you're there.

## Paying

* Cash is the norm. Card is mostly accepted, but having a decent buffer of backup cash is a good idea. { In some places they might ask "cash or card?" - note that cash in Japanese is "genkin" (現金), this is sometimes confused for "genki" (元気) - "how are you" }
* Don't hand the person at the register cash; instead place it in the small tray (usually blue) on the counter.

## Identity

* In Japanese, you'd typically write your surname first - if you're asked for your name, the surname is expected.

# Fashion

**Please be aware** that there are fundamental differences in physique between the West and the East - don't judge yourself based on their ideals.

## Beauty Ideals

Japanese people aim to be slender and pale. As a result most people cover all of their skin from the sun (even in summer), eat relatively small portions, and lifting weights is rare. In addition, the averge Japanese person tends to be shorter than Westerners. This all leads to clothing sizes being relatively small. 

For some reason, having a "small face" is also seen as attractive - you might be complimented on it.

**If you're a larger person** do note that Japanese people might point out your size explicitly. Yes, it's rude but they don't seem to care. They will also comment on weight loss/gain.

## Clothing Sizes

If you're a western medium, you're probably a japanese large, or even x-large - of course this can feel disappointing, especially since larger western sizes don't translate to something that exists in normal stores. Just remember that you are beautiful the way you are <3

In general, the sizes are S, M, L, etc. even in button-down shirts/pants/suits - but it may vary.



## Shoe Sizes

Japanese shoe sizes are (kind of) measured in centimeters. Size 28 (EU 43) is usually the largest size most places carry.


## Trends

In general, the color scheme is quite muted.

* At work: a suit (women too) or uniform is worn - exceptions are rare.
* Females: Flow-y, lace-y, and "feminine". Skirts and dresses are common. Showing any skin (even arms) is rare.
* Males: Oversized shirts, silk button downs, "preppy". Usually planned, but casual.
* Alternative: In general, really out there. Usually direct contrast to the conservative norm. Mostly in places like Harajuku.

## Tattoos

Tattoos are mostly fine in an everyday setting, especially if you're a foreigner. The only real struggle will be to enter public baths (including at hotels/ryokan).

## Glasses

Japanese people tend to have really narrow nose bridges, as such, it's to be extremly difficult to even find a pair of glasses that fits if your nose bridge is even somewhat pronounced. As a caucasian I wouldn't expect to get new frames in Japan.

## Hair(dressing)

Hairdressers/Barbers will most likely not be used to working with hair of your quality and as such the results may vary. Get a haircut *before* going to Japan, unless you're doing it "for the experience"(?). If you need a specialty hairdresser to do your hair - do it at home instead (unless the speciality is Japanese style).

## Traditional Clothing

There is a bunch of exciting and relatively cheap traditional clothing to try in Japan. Usually the traditional clothing is worn at ryokan or at festivals, though, in historic areas there are also kimono rentals that will set you up appropriately. There are so many different garments to choose from. For example, wearing a "jinbei" to a festival on a hot summer day is just perfect.

Yes, you **can** wear a kimono - no, it's **not** cultural appropriation. Japanese people love seeing foreigners/anyone appreciating their traditional clothes.

## Secondhand

Second hand in Japan is extremely good, especially if you can live with minor flaws.

See the document "Secondhand.md".

## Miscellaneous

* Sunglasses are rare - lightly-tinted are "in", though.
* Masks are sometimes worn as a fashion accessory or to hide a no-make up face.
* Japanese people tend to not wear a scent.
* Facial hair is uncommon.
* Baldness is uncommon - usually the hair is trimmed to leave stubble, or if involontary - as a combover.

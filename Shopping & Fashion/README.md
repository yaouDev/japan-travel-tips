# Fashion

There are some differences in average clothing sizes and proportions between many Japanese brands and many Western brands. This is mostly a reflection of fashion-market norms, available sizing, and local consumer demand - try not to compare yourself harshly.

## Beauty Ideals

Contemporary beauty trends in Japan often emphasize fair skin and a slim silhouette. Sun protection (hats, UV umbrellas, long sleeves) is common, especially among women. While gym culture is growing, fashion tends to prioritize lean lines over visibly muscular builds. As a result, clothing in many stores skews toward smaller sizes compared with many Western retailers.

For some reason, having a "small face" is also seen as attractive - you might be complimented on it.

Comments about appearance; weight changes, height, etc. - may be more direct than some visitors are used to. This isn’t intended as rudeness; norms around commenting on physical traits differ by culture and generation. Don't be surprised if a Japanese person calls you fat - even if you're not!

## Clothing Sizes

Japanese clothing sizes often run smaller than those in many Western countries. Someone who wears a medium in US/EU brands might find they need a large or XL in some Japanese stores. Larger sizes may be limited in stock, especially outside major cities.

In general, the sizes are S, M, L, etc. even in button-down shirts/pants/suits - but it may vary.



## Shoe Sizes

Japanese shoe sizes are (kind of) measured in centimeters. Size 28 (EU 43) is usually the largest size most places carry.


## Trends (Tendencies)

In general, the color scheme is quite muted.

* At work: a suit (women too) or uniform is worn - exceptions are rare (but vary by industry, of course).
* Females: Flow-y, lace-y, and "feminine". Skirts and dresses are common. Modesty is norm in most places - revealing clothing is rare.
* Males: Oversized shirts, silk button downs, "preppy". Usually planned, but casual.
* Alternative: In general, really out there. Usually direct contrast to the conservative norm. Mostly in places like Harajuku.

## Tattoos

Tattoos are mostly fine in an everyday setting, especially if you're a foreigner. The only real struggle will be to enter public baths (including at hotels/ryokan). 

## Glasses

Many Japanese eyewear brands design frames for slimmer nose bridges, which can make fit tricky for some visitors. Larger international chains (JINS, Zoff) carry a variety of fits, but if you rely on a specific style, consider bringing your preferred frames. **Don't** underestimate this point.

## Hair(dressing)

Hairdressers/Barbers will most likely not be used to working with hair of your quality and as such the results may vary. Get a haircut *before* going to Japan, unless you're doing it "for the experience"(?). If you need a specialty hairdresser to do your hair - do it at home instead (unless the speciality is Japanese style).

## Traditional Clothing

There is a bunch of exciting and relatively cheap traditional clothing to try in Japan. Usually the traditional clothing is worn at ryokan or at festivals, though, in historic areas there are also kimono rentals that will set you up appropriately. There are so many different garments to choose from. For example, wearing a "jinbei" to a festival on a hot summer day is just perfect.

Yes, you **can** wear a kimono - no, it's **not** cultural appropriation. Japanese people love seeing foreigners/anyone appreciating their traditional clothes.

## Secondhand

Second hand in Japan is extremely good, especially if you can live with minor flaws.

See the document "Secondhand.md".

## Miscellaneous

* Sunglasses are rare - lightly-tinted are "in", though.
* Masks are sometimes worn as a fashion accessory or to hide a no-make up face.
* Japanese people tend to not wear a scent.
* Facial hair is uncommon (in the workplace, might be more accepted in more eccentric/creative occupations).
* Completely bald heads are uncommon - usually the hair is trimmed to leave stubble, or if involontary - as a combover (or similar).

# Vocabulary

* Hiragana = the standard japanese alphabet
* Katakana = the alphabet used for foreign words (similar to hiragana)
* Kanji = symbolic characters with inherent meaning, similar to chinese characters. (extreme variation, 10,000+)

## What To Learn

My top recommendation is to learn katakana - the borrowed-word alphabet. If you pronouce English words through the alphabet, the Japanese will understand you perfectly. It might feel "racist", but it's not. Ordering a coffee can prove difficult, it will be easier to order a "koohii". Even if the common word for something isn't derived from English you'll be able to communicate with English nouns this way.

## Grammatical Rules

### Long Vowels

* ou = long o
* ei = long e

For example, "sensei" = "sensee".



### Desu/Masu

To do a formal word ending you either add desu or masu to your sentence ends. Desu is for noun endings and masu for verb endings. It's slightly more complex than this in reality. "Gozaimasu" is a bit special as it's (arguably) archaic, but still included in set phrases (like thank you and good morning).

When speaking to strangers/staff; polite language is (arguably) expected.

NOTE: The "u" in these suffixes are silent.



### Suffixes (Ka/Ne/Yo)

* Ka = indicates the sentence was a question
* Ne = indicates you know what they're talking about
* Yo = indicates they're telling you something

Can be combined and have very complex nuances.

## Concepts that are "unique" to Japan

Words that people use to refer to concepts that are mostly only seen in Japan (or refers to a Japanese version of something)

* ようこそ (youkoso) - Welcome { the nuance is more like "welcome to japan" }

* どういたしまして (douitashimashite) - You're welcome
* お預かりいたします (oazukari itashimasu) - I've received (your money) { usu. said by person handling your payment, no reply necessary }
